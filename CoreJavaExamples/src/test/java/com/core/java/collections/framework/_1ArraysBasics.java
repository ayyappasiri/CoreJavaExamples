 * <i>If we want to represent huge sets of data then instead of going for with
 * individual variables, its suggestible to go for Arrays</i><br>
 * 
 * <h2>Limitations of Arrays</h2>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li><i>Arrays cannot grow in size after reaching the max size.</i></li>
 * <li><i>Once an array is declared with a certain type (ex: int) you cannot
 * place other type of objects in normal Arrays (ex: String), but this
 * limitation can be overcome if we declare an array as Object Array.</i></li>
 * <li>Unlike other Data Structures like lists, sets, maps etc., Arrays doesn't
 * have already available methods for sorting, searching etc., we have to
 * implement on our own. But this can be overcome to an extent using Arrays
 * class, which has provided some methods for sorting, searching etc., but not
 * everything is covered.</li>
